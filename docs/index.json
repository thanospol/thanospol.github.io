Methods: GMT relies on a fast volume integral equation solver, MARIE, for the forward path, and a novel regularization method, match regularization, designed specifically for electrical property estimation from noisy measurements. We performed simulations with three different tissue-mimicking numerical phantoms of different complexity, using synthetic transmit sensitivity maps with realistic noise levels as the measurements. We performed an experiment at 7 T using an eight-channel coil and a uniform phantom. Results: We showed that GMT could estimate relative permittivity and conductivity from noisy magnetic resonance measurements with an average error as low as 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, over the entire volume of the numerical phantom. Voxel resolution did not affect GMT performance and is currently limited only by the memory of the graphics processing unit. In the experiment, GMT could estimate electrical properties within 5% of the values measured with a dielectric probe. Conclusion: This work demonstrated the feasibility of GMT with match regularization, suggesting that it could be effective for accurate.","tags":null,"title":"Noninvasive estimation of electrical properties from magnetic resonance measurements via global Maxwell tomography and match regularization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

The resulting electromagnetic fields are computed using an ultrafast volume integral solver, which are used as basis functions for the uSNR and uGF computations. Results: Our generalized uSNR calculation shows good convergence in the sphere and the head and is in close agreement with the dyadic Green's function approach in the uniform sphere. In both models, the uSNR versus B0 trend was linear at shallow depths and supralinear at deeper locations. At equivalent positions, the rate of increase of the uSNR with B0 was greater in the sphere than in the head model. The uGFs were lower in the realistic head than in the sphere for acceleration in the anterior-posterior direction, but similar for the left-right direction. Conclusion: The uSNR and uGFs are computable in nonuniform body models and provide fundamental performance limits for human imaging with close-fitting MRI array coils.","tags":null,"title":"The ultimate signal-to-noise ratio in realistic body models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The approach is based on integral equation methods decomposed into two domains: 1) the RF coil array and shield, and 2) the human body region where the load is placed. The analysis of multiple coil designs is accelerated by introducing the pre-computed magnetic resonance Green functions (MRGFs), which describe how the particular body model used responds to incident fields from external sources. These MRGFs, which are pre- computed once for a given body model, can be combined with any integral equation solver and re-used for the analysis of many coil designs. This approach provides a fast, yet comprehensive, analysis of coil designs, including the port S-parameters and the electromagnetic field distribution within the inhomogeneous body. The method solves the full wave electromagnetic problem for a head array in few minutes, achieving a speed up of over 150 fold with root mean square errors in the electromagnetic field maps smaller than 0.4% when compared to the unaccelerated integral equation based solver. This enables the characterization of a large number of RF coil designs in a reasonable time, which is a first step towards automatic optimization of multiple parameters in the design of transmit arrays, as illustrated in the manuscript, but also receive arrays.","tags":null,"title":"Fast electromagnetic analysis of MRI transmit RF coils based on accelerated integral equation methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.

We derive fundamental limits to the optical response of absorptive systems, bounding the largest enhancements possible given intrinsic material losses. Through basic conservation-of-energy principles, we derive geometry-independent limits to per-volume absorption and scattering rates, and to local-density-of-states enhancements that represent the power radiated or expended by a dipole near a material body. We provide examples of structures that approach our absorption and scattering limits at any frequency; by contrast, we find that common “antenna” structures fall far short of our radiative LDOS bounds, suggesting the possibility for significant further improvement. Underlying the limits is a simple metric, $x^2/Im{(x)}$ for a material with susceptibility $x$, that enables broad technological evaluation of lossy materials across optical frequencies.","tags":null,"title":"Fundamental limits to the optical response of lossy media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Unlike previous scattering formulations based on field and/or surface unknowns, our work exploits powerful techniques from the volume-integral equation (VIE) method, in which electromagnetic scattering is described in terms of volumetric current unknowns throughout the bodies. The resulting trace formulas (boxed equations) involve products of well-studied VIE matrices and describe power and momentum transfer between objects with spatially varying material properties and fluctuation characteristics. We demonstrate that thanks to the low-rank properties of the associated matrices, these formulas are susceptible to fast-trace computations based on iterative methods, making practical calculations tractable. We apply our techniques to study thermal radiation, heat transfer, and fluorescence in complicated geometries, checking our method against established techniques best suited for homogeneous bodies as well as applying it to obtain predictions of radiation from complex bodies with spatially varying permittivities and/or temperature profiles.","tags":null,"title":"Fluctuating volume-current formulation of electromagnetic fluctuations in inhomogeneous media: incandescence and luminescence in arbitrary geometries","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

In addition, appropriate interchanges in the order of the associated one-dimensional integrations result in further regularization of the overall integrals. The final integrands are analytic functions with respect to all variables involved and, hence, the integrals can be efficiently evaluated by means of simple Gaussian integration.
